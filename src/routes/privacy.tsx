          BetterBox is a faster, denser web client for your Google inboxes,
          built on the Gmail API. It is operated by Aidan McAlister as an
          individual developer (&ldquo;BetterBox,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo;
          &ldquo;us&rdquo;). This policy explains what data we access, why, how
          long we keep it, and the choices you have. BetterBox is not affiliated
          with or endorsed by Google.
        </p>

        <Callout>
          BetterBox is in active development and currently restricted to
          approved test accounts while Google verification is pending. It is a
          client for Gmail — not a new email service. Your email continues to
          live in your Google account.

            <li>
              <strong>OAuth tokens:</strong> the access and refresh tokens
              Google issues so the app can stay signed in and call the Gmail API
              on your behalf. These are stored securely in our database.

            access to the systems that hold your data. No method of transmission
            or storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute
            security, but we work to protect your information and to respond
            promptly to any incident.
