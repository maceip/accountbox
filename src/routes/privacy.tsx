          AccountBox is a local workbench for connected accounts and apps. It
          starts with Gmail and GitHub sources, runs local model and skill flows
          in your browser, and uses provider APIs only when a connected source
          needs live data or an approved action. It is operated by Aidan
          McAlister as an individual developer (&ldquo;AccountBox,&rdquo;
          &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo;). This policy explains what data we
          access, why, how long we keep it, and the choices you have. AccountBox
          is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google.
        </p>

        <Callout>
          AccountBox is in active development and has not yet completed
          Google&rsquo;s verification, so when you sign in Google shows an
          &ldquo;unverified app&rdquo; warning. This is expected: to continue,
          click <strong>Advanced</strong>, then{" "}
          <strong>Proceed to AccountBox</strong>. It is a client for Gmail, not
          a new email service. Your email continues to live in your Google
          account.
        </Callout>

        <Section title="1. Information we access and collect">
          <p>
            We keep what we collect to the minimum needed to run the client.

              <strong>Basic profile:</strong> your name, email address, profile

              in and to label your connected source.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>OAuth tokens:</strong> the access and refresh tokens
              Google issues so the app can stay signed in and call the Gmail API
              on your behalf. These are encrypted at rest in our database.

            With the <Mono>gmail.modify</Mono> scope you grant, AccountBox can
            read your messages and their metadata, send messages on your behalf,
            and change message state (such as marking as read or adjusting
            labels). This data is fetched on demand to display and act on your
            mail inside the app.

              We do not store the contents of your emails on our servers.

            Message headers and bodies are retrieved from Google when you open
            or act on them and are held only transiently in your browser to
            render the interface. We do not maintain a server-side copy or
            archive of your mailbox.

          <Subhead>From GitHub (optional, if you connect it)</Subhead>

            AccountBox can show your GitHub pull requests, review requests, and
            issues (those assigned to or opened by you) alongside your inbox. If
            you connect a GitHub account, we store the OAuth tokens GitHub
            provides (encrypted at rest, the same as Google) and use them to
            make read-only calls to the GitHub API on your behalf. We do not
            write to your repositories, and your GitHub data is fetched on
            demand rather than stored on our servers. Connecting GitHub is
            optional; you can use AccountBox with Gmail alone.
