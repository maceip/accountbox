# BetterBox

**All your inboxes. One tab.**

A new interface for the Gmail accounts you already have. Built on the Gmail API, not another email service.

Your mail stays in Gmail. BetterBox does not move, migrate, or store it. It puts what you check all day in one place: your inboxes, your GitHub pull requests, and (soon) your Linear issues. Think tiling window manager for your inboxes.

## Setup

You'll need [Bun](https://bun.sh), a PostgreSQL database, and a Google Cloud OAuth app.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aidankmcalister/betterbox.git
cd betterbox
bun install
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the core values in `.env`: `DATABASE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL` (`http://localhost:3000` locally), and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (generate with `npx auth@latest secret`; it also encrypts OAuth tokens at rest).

**Google (required).** In the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com), enable the Gmail API and, on the OAuth consent screen, add the `gmail.modify` scope (keep the app in Testing to skip Google's ~$750/yr assessment). Create an OAuth client with redirect URI `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`, then set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Create the schema and start it:

```bash
bun run db:push
bun run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

Sign in with Google. `ALLOWED_EMAILS` is a comma-separated allowlist for new accounts (empty allows anyone). For owner tools (seeded demo accounts): `bun run set-owner you@example.com`.

**GitHub (optional).** Enables the Pull requests page. Create an OAuth app in [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) with callback `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`, set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, then connect it from Settings. It requests `read:user` and `repo` (`repo` so it can read your private PRs).

**Linear (coming soon).** The Issues page isn't built yet. When it ships it'll work like GitHub: set `LINEAR_CLIENT_ID` and `LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET`, then connect it from Settings.

## Features

- **Every inbox, one screen.** Multiple Gmail accounts as panes you drag, split, and resize.
- **Read fast.** Movable reading pane with inline reply. HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe with remote subresources stripped or proxied, so trackers never see your IP.
- **Command palette.** Compose, switch accounts, search, and export from one menu (⌘K).
- **Pull requests.** Open PRs, review requests, and CI status, live from GitHub.
- **Tags are Gmail labels.** Create, apply, rename, recolor. Stored in Gmail, not here.
- **Private by design.** Mail fetched live, held only in your browser. Tokens encrypted at rest. No analytics, no server-side mail.
- **Open source.** MIT licensed. Audit it, fork it, self-host it free.

## Self-host or hosted

Self-host is free and open source: your own OAuth app, your own infra, your own credentials. Nothing is gated, no data leaves your machine. The example `.env` sets `IS_SELF_HOSTED=true`, which hides the marketing layer (landing, waitlist, pricing); unset it to run that locally.

Hosted ($5/mo) is the same code, run by us. Waitlisted while I gauge demand: Google's ~$750/yr assessment for third-party Gmail apps needs justifying first.
