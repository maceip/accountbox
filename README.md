# BetterBox

**Gmail, at developer speed.**

A fast, dense, keyboard-first client for every Google inbox you have — built on the Gmail API, not another email service.

> [!WARNING]
> **Mega-alpha.** BetterBox is in active development and moves fast — expect rough edges and the occasional `Soon` badge. Self-host works today, straight from source; the hosted plan is behind a [waitlist](https://betterbox.dev) while Google verifies the app.

Your mail already lives in Gmail. BetterBox doesn't move it, migrate it, or store it — it's a _better client_ for the accounts you already have. Think tiling window manager for your inboxes: every account on one screen, every action a keystroke away, with real developer tooling (pull requests, webhooks, API logs, raw MIME) built in.

## Quick start

You'll need [Bun](https://bun.sh), a PostgreSQL database, and a Google Cloud OAuth app.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aidankmcalister/betterbox.git
cd betterbox
bun install
```

Create a `.env`:

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=...          # also encrypts OAuth tokens at rest
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
# optional — enables the Pull requests page
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

In the Google Cloud console: enable the Gmail API, add the `gmail.modify` scope, and set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`.

```bash
bun run db:push   # set up the database
bun run dev       # http://localhost:3000
```

That's it. Want the owner-only tools (seeded test accounts + demo mode)? Run `bun run set-owner you@example.com`.

## Features

- **Every inbox, one screen.** Link multiple Gmail accounts and arrange them as panes you drag, split, and resize like a tiling WM. Colored dots keep accounts apart; composed views merge them.
- **Read fast.** A movable reading pane renders the whole conversation with inline reply. HTML email renders in a sanitized, sandboxed iframe with remote images proxied (trackers never see your IP); raw MIME is one keystroke away.
- **`⌘K` everything.** A command palette for compose, account switching, search, export, and settings — plus `G I` to inbox and `⌥1–9` to jump between accounts.
- **Pull requests.** Link GitHub (an account link, not a new login) and see your PRs — open, awaiting your review, approved, merged — in a dense list pulled live from the GitHub API.
- **Developer tooling.** Webhooks, an API call log, and exports to Markdown / JSON / plain text.
- **Tags are Gmail labels.** Create, apply, rename, recolor, and delete labels; the **Labeled** view groups mail per tag. BetterBox stores nothing about them.
- **Private by design.** Mail is fetched live and held only in your browser — never on our servers. OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest. No analytics.

## Self-host or hosted

Self-host is free and open source — bring your own Google OAuth app and run it on your own infra. Hosted ($5/mo, 7-day trial) is the same code, run and updated by us, for people who don't want to manage it. The waitlist is for hosted only; self-host isn't gated.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: `bun install`, `bun run dev`, and run `bun run typecheck` + `bun run format` before pushing.
