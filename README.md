# BetterBox

**All your inboxes. One tab.**

A new interface for the Gmail accounts you already have. Built on the Gmail API, not another email service.

Your mail stays in Gmail. BetterBox does not move, migrate, or store it. It puts what you check all day in one place: your inboxes, your GitHub pull requests, and (soon) your Linear issues. Think tiling window manager for your inboxes.

## Setup

You'll need [Bun](https://bun.sh), PostgreSQL, and a Google Cloud OAuth app.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aidankmcalister/betterbox.git
cd betterbox
bun install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env` (the comments explain each value), then:

```bash
bun run db:push   # create the schema
bun run dev       # http://localhost:3000
```

Sign in with Google. `ALLOWED_EMAILS` is a comma-separated allowlist (empty allows anyone). For owner tools (seeded demo accounts): `bun run set-owner you@example.com`.

**Google (required).** In the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com), enable the Gmail API, add the `gmail.modify` scope, and create an OAuth client with redirect URI `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`. Keep the app in Testing to skip Google's ~$750/yr assessment.

**GitHub (optional).** Powers the Pull requests page. Create an OAuth app in [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) with callback `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`, add the keys to `.env`, then connect it from Settings. Scopes: `read:user`, `repo` (or `public_repo` for public only).

**Linear (soon).** The Issues page is on the way.

## Features

- **Every inbox, one screen.** Multiple Gmail accounts as panes you drag, split, and resize.
- **Read fast.** Movable reading pane with inline reply. HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe with remote subresources stripped or proxied, so trackers never see your IP.
- **Command palette.** Compose, switch accounts, search, and export from one menu (⌘K).
- **Pull requests.** Open PRs, review requests, and CI status, live from GitHub.
- **Tags are Gmail labels.** Create, apply, rename, recolor. Stored in Gmail, not here.
- **Private by design.** Mail fetched live, held only in your browser. Tokens encrypted at rest. No analytics, no server-side mail.
- **Open source.** MIT licensed. Audit it, fork it, self-host it free.

## Self-host or hosted

Self-host is free and open source: your own OAuth app, your own infra, your own credentials. Nothing is gated, no data leaves your machine. The example `.env` sets `IS_SELF_HOSTED=true`, which hides the marketing layer (landing, waitlist, pricing); unset it to run that locally.

Hosted ($5/mo) is the same code, run by us. Waitlisted while I gauge demand: Google's ~$750/yr assessment for third-party Gmail apps needs justifying first.
